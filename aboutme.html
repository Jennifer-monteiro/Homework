          <h2>WHO <span>AM I? </span></h2>
          <p>I am Jennifer. I am from Brazil, currently living in Philadelphia, PA. I first decided to come to the the United States to sharpen my english and start pursuing a career in IT.
          Technology has always been a passion of mine. It all started when I was 10 years old and had my first computer. Throughout the years I was able to take some classes and learn some skills IT related. I love challenges and problem solving. I know Software Developer is an area where I will thrive.</p>

          <h2>Hobbies </h2>
          <p>I love reading books all day long. From fiction, to romance, sci-fi and so on. I spend hours and hours reading one book after another. I also like traveling and have been to a couple countries like Turkey, Portugal, Scotland, France, etc. 
            I like watching tv and recently I have been watching lots of Turkish series. When I am not doing any of these things you may find me going out with my friends and hiking with my dog.
